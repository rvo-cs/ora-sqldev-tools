### Reminder about getting started using tools

This is a _personal_ reminder about how to configure and get started using 
the following tools:
* [SQL*Plus](sqlplus)
* SQLcl
* SQL Developer

Remark: I use the above clients on Windows workstations mostly, hence some
Windows-isms are to be expected here.

All the above are Oracle-supplied tools. SQL*Plus and SQLcl are remarkedly (and purposely)
similar. SQL Developer differs in that, being a GUI tool, in principle many things
are configured in Preferences dialogs, rather than in a login.sql script.
